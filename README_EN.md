## ℹ️ Overview

MindStudio MemScope (msMemScope) is a memory analysis tool developed based on the Ascend hardware to locate memory problems during model training and inference. It provides functions such as memory leak detection, memory comparison, memory block monitoring, memory decomposition, and identification of inefficient memory, helping you locate and handle problems.

## ⚙️ Features

msMemScope provides memory collection and analysis functions.
